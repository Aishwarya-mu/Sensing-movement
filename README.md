# Sensing-movement

In this project, our mission is to improve the quality of life through continuous health and well-being monitor. The sensor tracks the quality of sleep and body vitals while a user is sleeping.

People move during their sleep. These movements are very important to track muscle activity which is a crucial parameter for sleep analysis. It is also an indication of restlessness during sleep.

In the test data folder you can find 5 files of 4 minutes of vibration data each with some movement instances in them.
